My configs for MacOS and Linux (tested on Ubuntu). Also
includes the most user-friendly MacOS [installation
script](.local/bin/macdefaults) ever.

### Screenshots

I try to comply to the [XDG
standard](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
as much as possible. **My `$HOME` directory is litter free!**

XDG               | Linux & MacOS
------------------|-----------------
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config`
`XDG_DATA_HOME`   | `~/.local/share`
`XDG_CACHE_HOME`  | `~/.cache`
bin               | `~/.local/bin`

### Installation
If you just want to install the dotfiles:
```bash
$ curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yochem/dotfiles/main/.local/bin/dotinstall | $(which bash)
```
This script will check if there are any existing files and move them to
`$HOME/dotfiles-backup/`. It uses a Git bare repository to manage the
dotfiles.

If you want to install Brew packages, Pip packages, change some MacOS
`defaults`, update Bash, change the Dock and even more:
```bash
$ $HOME/.local/bin/install
```
Which looks something like:

Where the users press 'y' to accept or any other key to skip (no key pressed
at creating the dock).

### Why?
*"There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about.
It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The
trouble with computers is that you 'play' with them."* -- Richard Feynman
